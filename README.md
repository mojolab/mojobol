# mojoबोल
IVR platform that combines the best of as many worlds as possible. 

Mojबोल uses the work of the Swara (http://github.com/mojolab/swara) platform to create a new engine that can read, 
interpret and play as an automated telephonic response, call flows made in Verboice Desinger (http://github.com/instedd/verboice) 

The call flows can be designed and exported from http://verboice.com
Currently supported Verboice call flow steps are 

1. Play

2. Record

3. Menu

4. Key input (capture)
